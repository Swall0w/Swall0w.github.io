# About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/face2.jpeg">

FUJITAKE Masato (藤武将人) is a Co-Founder of Fast Accounting, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, and Chief Research Scientist of its R&D group, FA Research.
His technical interests include computer vision, and machine learning, especially document analysis recently.


He received his Ph.D. degree in information science and technology.
He was a [Computer Vision and Discrete Geometry Group (Sugimoto Laboratory)](http://www.dgcv.nii.ac.jp/index.html) member at the National Institute of Informatics (NII), Japan.
Before commencing his graduate studies at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI,
he earned his bachelor and master’s degree in robotics and information science at the Shibaura Institute of Technology in Tokyo, Japan, where he was born and grew up.

He is enthusiastic about contributing to open-source projects, such as a model analyzer called [torchstat](https://github.com/Swall0w/torchstat) and a detection error analyzer named [Nobunaga](https://github.com/FastAccounting/nobunaga).
He is a member of IEEE and The Association for Natural Language Processing.
He is also a reviewer of IEEE conferences.
