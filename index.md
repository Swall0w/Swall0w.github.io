# Biography
Masato Fujitake is a second-year Ph.D. student in information science and technology, particularly interested in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning. 
He is a Computer Vision and Discrete Geometry Group (Sugimoto Laboratory) member at the National Institute of Informatics (NII), Japan.

Before commencing his graduate studies at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI,
he earned his bachelor and masterâ€™s degree in robotics and information science at the 
Shibaura Institute of Technology in Tokyo, Japan, where he was born and grew up.

His research focuses on computer vision, in particular on understanding and processing of recognition and object detection in videos.
Recently, he has been interested in video object detection using deep neural networks.

Video object detection is challenging and essential in practical applications, such as surveillance cameras for traffic control and public security.
Unlike the video in natural scenes,
the surveillance video tends to contain dense and small objects (typically vehicles) in their appearances.
Therefore, existing methods for surveillance object detection utilize still-image object detection approaches with rich feature extractors at the expense of their run-time speeds.
The run-time speed, however, becomes essential when the video is being streamed.
In this paper, we exploit temporal information in videos to enrich the feature maps, proposing the first temporal attention based external memory network for the live stream of video.
Extensive experiments on real-world traffic surveillance benchmarks demonstrate the real-time performance of the proposed model while keeping comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art.

This paper describes the development of a robust object recognition system which combines object's parts, for automatic construction equipment tracking camera on unmanned construction site. Although a construction equipment operator monitors manually and operates construction equipment through captured surveillance camera video in the worksite of unmanned construction, they need an automatic tracking system for construction equipment in order to work efficiently. Since there is difficulty of automation such as some parts of construction equipment are not captured in the video because of construction works, we have developed a robust system which recognizes construction equipment using combination of their parts. Before we start making whole system, we developed object recognition algorithm for construction equipment. The object: construction equipment, recognition algorithm discussed in this paper is developed based on estimating its type by combining its parts found in an image. This system has three features to realize the process: part extraction step, part recognition step and part combination step. The part extraction step extracts object candidates including parts of construction equipment from an input image. In the part recognition step, they are recognized and labeled. The part combination step combines the labeled data and estimates construction equipment's type using neural networks. Experimental results show that the system which combines parts of construction equipment is able to estimate its type even if some parts of it are hidden. We also describe its improvement in terms of the processing time.
